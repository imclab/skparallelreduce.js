=========

A JavaScript/GLSL library for performing parallel reductions in Three.js.

This is useful if you need to do binary operations, such as a sum, on the data of a GPU texture.

It is possible to extract the final reduced results out to the CPU as floating-point values, if necessary.

Currently supported binary operations:
